# Debugger

This example uses **object-diagram-js** to visualize debugging information as an object diagram.

## About

This example is a node-style web application that builds a user interface around the diagram-js framework.

## Building

You need a [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org) development stack with [npm](https://npmjs.org) installed to build the project.

To install all project dependencies, execute:

```
npm install
```

Check, test, and build the application (including **object-diagram-js**) via

```
npm run all
```

You may also spawn a development setup by executing the following:

```
npm start
```

Serve the application locally or via a web server (nginx, apache, embedded).
