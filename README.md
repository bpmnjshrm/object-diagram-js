[![Build & Test](https://github.com/timKraeuter/object-diagram-modeler/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/timKraeuter/object-diagram-modeler/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

## Try the object diagram modeler [here](https://timkraeuter.com/object-diagram-modeler/).

This repository contains two related projects.
1. The UI used in the [visual debugger IntelliJ plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/16851-visual-debugger) in the folder `debugger`.
2. An [object diagram modeler](https://timkraeuter.com/object-diagram-modeler/) based on **diagram-js** in the folder `modeler`.

In the future, we plan to eliminate the duplicate code shared between the two projects.
